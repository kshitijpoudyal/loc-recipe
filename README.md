# Recipe WIP

### Requirements

- Node.js and npm

### Getting started

Run the following command on your local environment:

``` bash
npm install
```

Then, you can run locally in development mode with live reload:

``` bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321) with your favorite browser
to see your project.

### Deploy to production (manual)

You can create an optimized production build with:

```shell
npm run build
```

All generated files are located at
`dist` folder, which you can deploy the folder to any hosting service you
prefer.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
